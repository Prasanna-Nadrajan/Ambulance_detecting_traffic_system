# üöë Smart Emergency Vehicle Detection System

> AI-powered traffic management system that automatically detects ambulances and emergency vehicles in real-time, triggering traffic signal preemption to reduce emergency response times and save lives.

## üìã Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Emergency vehicles like ambulances face significant delays at traffic intersections, directly impacting patient survival rates and emergency response effectiveness. Current traffic systems operate on fixed timing schedules, forcing emergency vehicles to navigate through red lights, creating dangerous situations and delaying critical medical care.

### Impact of the Problem
- **Delayed Emergency Response**: Every minute counts in medical emergencies. Traffic delays can mean the difference between life and death
- **Increased Accident Risk**: Emergency vehicles running red lights pose risks to both responders and civilians
- **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: Emergency services spend valuable time navigating traffic instead of providing care
- **Economic Costs**: Traffic delays increase operational costs for emergency services and healthcare systems

### Current Solutions and Their Limitations
- **Manual Override Systems**: Require human intervention, causing delays
- **Radio-based Preemption**: Limited range, requires additional equipment in vehicles
- **Fixed Emergency Lanes**: Not available in all areas, often blocked by regular traffic
- **Traffic Officer Coordination**: Resource-intensive and not available 24/7

## üí° Proposed Solution

An intelligent computer vision system that:
- **Automatically detects** ambulances and emergency vehicles using AI-powered image recognition
- **Instantly triggers** traffic signal changes to provide green light corridors
- **Operates 24/7** without human intervention
- **Integrates seamlessly** with existing traffic infrastructure
- **Provides real-time analytics** on emergency vehicle movements and system performance

## üéØ Project Objectives
